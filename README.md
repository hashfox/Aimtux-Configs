# Aimtux-Configs
Copy configs to `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive` and change the names to either `aimtux_settings_1.json` or `aimtux_settings_2.json`

**Tip**: It's better to strafe/hold with awp config. Always have cover when using it because otherwise it shoots too fast. The awp config can actually be pretty decent in hvh if you use it right.
