# Aimtux-Configs
Copy configs to `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive` and change the names to either `aimtux_settings_1.json` or `aimtux_settings_2.json`

**Tips about using AWP config properly**: It's better to strafe(adad)/hold with awp config. Always have cover when using it because otherwise it shoots too fast. The awp config can actually be pretty decent in hvh if you use it right. When using the awp config, If the enemy team uses fake angles, it might be a good idea to add pelvis/spine onto the config but otherwise keep it off. If pelvis/spin is added, make the autowall value a bit higher in order to compensate for the headshot damage that can't be inflicted since fake angles are on.

**Tips about legit config:**
You could use fake lag, depending on your situation. You could also turn off anti-flash to make it more legit as to hide from overwatch as much as possible.
